# Breathwork Web Application

## Overview
The Breathwork Web Application is designed to guide users through Wim Hof Breathing, a structured breathing exercise aimed at improving mental and physical well-being. The application will provide a guided experience with visual and audio cues, session tracking, and customizable settings.

## Features
### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- **Guided Breathing**: Users will complete 30 deep breaths per round.
- **Retention & Recovery**: The app will guide users to exhale and hold, followed by a recovery breath.
- **Three-Round Default**: The standard session will consist of three rounds.

### Phase 2: Enhancements
- **Visual Cues**: Animation to indicate inhale/exhale phases.
- **Audio Cues**: Voice guidance or sound prompts for breath pacing.
- **Session Tracking**: Users can track their breathing sessions and progress.
- **Custom Settings**: Adjustable breath counts and session durations.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask or FastAPI (Python-based, API-driven architecture)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for storing user sessions and data)
- **Frontend**: React (for an interactive and dynamic user experience)
- **Real-Time Features**: WebSockets via Flask-SocketIO or FastAPI WebSockets
- **Hosting**: Render, Vercel (frontend), AWS (scalability)
- **Audio/Visuals**: Web Audio API for guidance sounds, Three.js for immersive animations

## Goals
- **Demonstrate Full-Stack Development**: Backend API, database integration, and frontend UI/UX.
- **Apply Real-Time Functionality**: WebSockets for a responsive breathing guide.
- **Track User Engagement**: Store and visualize breathing session data.
- **Highlight Data Engineering Skills**: Efficient data structuring, API development, and web technologies.

## Next Steps
1. Set up the project repository.
2. Build a basic Flask/FastAPI backend with initial API routes.
3. Develop the frontend layout in React.
4. Implement real-time breathing guidance.
5. Expand with audio, visuals, and tracking features.
